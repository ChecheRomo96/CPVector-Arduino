# CPVector: Cross-Platform vector

CPVector is a library that provides an encapsulation for the `std::vector` class, enabling the implementation of the same functionality across various platforms in a unified manner. This library has been developed with the purpose of achieving cross-compatibility in different programming environments, while offering a familiar and user-friendly interface.

## Repository Structure

This repository serves as the primary repository for the CPVector project. It's worth noting that CPVector has been organized into separate repositories to structure the files by compatibility and to adhere to specific standards in each of its applications. Additional repositories include:

- [CPVector-Arduino](https://github.com/ChecheRomo96/CPVector-Arduino): Optimized and tested for use in Arduino projects.
- [CPVector-CMake](https://github.com/ChecheRomo96/CPVector-CMake): Provides a directory structure and CMake files to facilitate integration into larger projects.

## Key Features

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** CPVector is designed to work on different platforms, meaning you can write code that uses the `std::vector` functionality and run it on multiple environments without worrying about implementation differences.

- **Ease of Use:** By using the same interface as `std::vector`, developers familiar with C++'s Standard Template Library (STL) will find it comfortable to work with CPVector.

- **Integration with CMake:** The directory and CMake files are included in the repository, making it easier to compile and use in larger projects.

- **Arduino Support:** CPVector has been optimized and tested for use in Arduino projects, making it an excellent choice for those seeking compatibility with this platform.

- **Dynamic Documentation:** The documentation may vary depending on the configuration of the package compilation, ensuring that it remains accurate and relevant to the specific build.

- **Clear Documentation:** The library's documentation has been generated using Doxygen, making it easier to understand the provided functions, methods, and classes by CPVector.
